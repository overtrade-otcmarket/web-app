## **Overview**
**Overtrade** is a revolutionary public OTC (Over-the-Counter) trading platform designed to enhance the trading experience for investors in the memecoin market. Unlike traditional private OTC platforms, Overtrade operates in a permissionless and public manner, ensuring that all trades are visible and accessible to anyone. This approach fosters transparency and trust among users, making it easier for buyers and sellers to connect and negotiate prices effectively.

Built with a focus on reducing slippage and market volatility, Overtrade offers features like automatic price adjustments to market rates, protecting investors from sudden price swings. By leveraging Pragma's Data Feed technology, Overtrade minimizes the risks associated with low liquidity, allowing traders to execute large orders without significant market impact.

Our platform provides a streamlined, user-friendly environment for conducting secure, efficient, and equitable trades, catering to both seasoned investors and newcomers in the crypto space. With Overtrade, we aim to set a new standard for public OTC trading, making it more accessible and beneficial for the wider crypto community.
